#### Description:
Huudini is an online clothing brand offering customizable hoodies and t-shirts. This project is a static website built to display the Huudini collection, provide contact links for ordering via Instagram or email, and offer information about the brand's products and services.

The website includes multiple pages:
- *Home Page*: Provides an overview of the brand, a call-to-action button, and a link to browse the shop.
- *Shop Page*: Displays products such as customizable t-shirts and hoodies, along with buttons that direct users to place orders via Instagram or email.
- *Our Services Page*: Describes the customization options available for the products, highlighting the quality of materials and fast delivery options.
- *Follow Us Section*: Contains links to the brand’s Instagram and TikTok accounts.

Each page is built using *HTML* and *CSS, and all the product images are organized in the **images folder*.

### Design Choices:
The website was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. Rather than a traditional checkout system, customers can directly contact the brand via Instagram or email to place orders, creating a more personal connection. This decision was made to align with the brand’s focus on customer relationships and custom-made apparel.
